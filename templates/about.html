  <h1>About</h1>

  <p> This is a project that reports the cost of living in the United States by state and year.</p>
  <p> The Cost of Living Index (COLI) is a measurement of the basic expenses of a location. It is also known as the Consumer Price Index. The cost of living
    of an average city in the country is set to 100.0 and every other location is assessed based on that scale. For example, in 2023, New York State has a
    COLI of 148.2, meaning it is 48.2% more expensive to live in New York than in an average state.
  </p>

  <p> PROTOTYPES!:</p>

  <img src="/ms1micro.jpeg" alt="micro" style="width:500px">
  <p> I received feedback to label the 100.0 baseline on the legend of the macro page and make it clear visually whether states are less or more expensive than the average.
    I also received feedback to emphasize the line graph of the state and demephasize that of the national average for the micro page.
  </p>
  <p> I will implement those changes. The state line could be a bright color, such as red or blue, and the U.S. average line could be grey. The pie chart will also contain the
    specific percentages of each sector.
